                    <h1>Why Do We Celebrate Freedom Day In South Africa?</h1>
                    <p>The 27th of April marks Freedom Day in South Africa. Freedom Day is a public holiday in South
                        Africa and is the
                        celebration and commemoration of the long struggle for democracy in the country. Freedom Day is
                        a day of respect and commemoration. Celebrated on the 27th of April each year, Freedom Day
                        honours the
                        anniversary of South Africa’s first non-racial election of 1994 and pays homage to the country’s
                        liberation from Apartheid rule, where the minority exercised prejudice political power over the
                        majority of the country.</p>

                <h1>History Of Freedom Day</h1>
                <p>Freedom Day is celebrated annually on the 27th of April in honour of the auspicious day in 1994 when
                    the first
                    non-racial election was held in the country. South Africa celebrates Freedom Day to mark the
                    liberation of our country
                    and its people from 300 years of colonialism, White minority domination, politically enforced
                    prejudice and Apartheid. <br><br>

                    Apartheid was officially implemented in South Africa in 1948; however, colonialism and oppression of
                    the African
                    majority had plagued various countries throughout the African continent since as early as the
                    1600s.<br><br>

                    Under the brutal Apartheid rule, indigenous people of colour in South Africa were denied the right
                    to vote and hence did
                    not have a say in the political governing and running of the country. During Apartheid, the majority
                    of South Africans
                    were excluded from any form of political power or influence.<br><br>

                    Freedom Day honours those who fought for our country’s liberation, and the many men and women who
                    suffered through
                    incarceration, bannings and torture on behalf of the oppressed during Apartheid.
